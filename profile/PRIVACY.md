2. **How We Handle Your Information**

- **Registration Information:** When you sign up, we respect your privacy by not requiring any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We only ask for a username, password, and invitation code.

- **Hashed IP Addresses:** To ensure fairness and security, we gather hashed IP addresses. Each collected IP address undergoes a privacy-enhancing process. This process involves anonymization by altering the last octet to '0' (e.g., 1.1.1.1 becomes 1.1.1.0), followed by hashing using the xxh3 algorithm.

- **Images:** When you upload an image, we create a reference to it in our database. The image data itself is stored securely in an S3 bucket, with the hosting server employing LUKS encryption to ensure the highest level of data security.

3. **Receiving and Storing E-Mail Content**

When you receive an E-Mail through our platform, the content of the E-Mail is stored on our servers' disks. It's important to note that this E-Mail content is stored in an unencrypted format & that we recommend making use of PGP to encrypt your E-Mails. However, we utilize LUKS encryption at the server level to enhance the security of our overall infrastructure.

While we utilize Cloudflare for various aspects of catgir.ls, it's important to mention that we do not employ Cloudflare services for our E-Mail server. Our E-Mail server operates separately, ensuring a dedicated approach to E-Mail communication.

We believe in maintaining a balance between convenience and security, and we're actively exploring options to further enhance the security of E-Mail content stored on our servers.

4. **Disclosure of Your Information**

We recognize the value of safeguarding your information and respect your trust. We want to assure you that we do not share, sell, or trade your personal information with third parties for commercial purposes. Your information is treated with the utmost confidentiality and is disclosed only in the following limited circumstances:

- **Legal Requirements:** We may share your information if required by law, such as in response to a valid court order, subpoena, or governmental request.

- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or transfer of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of the business transition. However, such transfers will be carried out in compliance with applicable privacy laws.

5. **Retention and Removal of Information**

Given that we do not hold any personal data, data retention is not applicable. We do not retain, store, or process any user-specific data beyond the minimal operational information necessary for your interaction with our services.

We respect your right to control your information. If you wish to access the minimal operational data we retain or would like it to be deleted, you can contact us at [**contact@catgir.ls**]. We are here to assist you and accommodate your preferences regarding the limited data associated with your interaction on our platform.

6. **Cloudflare**

It's important to mention that while Cloudflare plays a critical role in enhancing the security of our platform, their services may involve the collection of certain information for analytics and security purposes. For details on how Cloudflare handles data and protects your privacy, you can review Cloudflare's Privacy Policy [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy)

7. **Age Requirements**

At catgir.ls, we are committed to providing a safe and compliant online environment for all users. To ensure the privacy and security of our platform, we have established age requirements for users who wish to create an account and access our services.

Users must be at least 13 years of age to register and use our services. This aligns with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States. If you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to create an account or use our services.

In regions where the age of consent is higher than 13 years, users are required to meet the age of consent as defined by their local regulations. We are committed to complying with relevant laws and ensuring that our platform is used responsibly and in accordance with legal requirements.

If you become aware of a user who is under the age of 13 and has created an account on catgir.ls, please contact us at [**contact@catgir.ls**]. We take reports of underage users seriously and will investigate the matter promptly.

8. **Reccomendations**

To ensure the confidentiality of your communications and interactions with us, we strongly recommend the following practices:

- **PGP Encryption:** We encourage you to use PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") encryption when communicating with us via email. PGP encryption adds an extra layer of security to your messages by using a combination of public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt content. By utilizing PGP encryption, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to your sensitive information during transmission. If you are unfamiliar with PGP encryption, we recommend exploring tutorials and resources to help you implement this valuable security measure.

- **E-Mail Clients:** Selecting a reputable and security-focused email client can significantly enhance the protection of your communications. We recommend using email clients like Mozilla Thunderbird, known for their strong security features and support for encryption standards like PGP. Thunderbird provides you with the tools to manage your encryption keys and send encrypted messages, ensuring that your sensitive data remains private and secure.
